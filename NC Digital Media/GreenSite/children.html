						<h3>What is Energy?</h3>
						<p>The energy can take a wide variety of forms - heat, light, mechanical, electrical, chemical, and nuclear energy. 
						There are two types of energy - stored (potential) energy and working (kinetic) energy.  For example, the food you eat contains chemical 
						energy, and your body stores this energy until you release it when you work or play.

						<h3>Energy Sources</h3>
						<p>We get most of our energy from nonrenewable energy sources, which include the fossil fuels - oil, natural gas, and coal.  They're called 
						fossil fuels because they were formed over millions and millions of years by the action of heat from the Earth's core and pressure from 
						rock and soil on the remains (or "fossils") of dead plants and animals.  Another nonrenewable energy source is the element uranium, whose 
						atoms we split (through a process called nuclear fission) to create heat and ultimately electricity.

						<h3>Using and Saving Energy</h3>
						<p>Wasting energy is the same as wasting money You've probably heard the grown-ups in your house say "Turn off the light!” or "Close the 
						refrigerator door!” Have you ever wondered why? Energy is there whenever we need it - so it's easy to forget where it comes from, or how much 
						it costs. It all adds up Every year, we use more energy than we did the year before. In fact, the amount of energy Americans use has doubled 
						about every 20 years. All of that energy adds up, and much of it is wasted by using too much or not using it wisely. Energy isn't free. 
						The grown-ups in your house pay for the all the electricity you use. So wasting energy is the same as wasting money - and we know that's not a 
						good idea! Wasting energy isn't good for the environment either. Most of the energy sources we depend on, like coal and natural gas, can't be 
						replaced - once we use them up, they're gone forever. Another problem is that most forms of energy can cause pollution.
