					<h2>History of the Active Leisure Complex</h2>
					<p>The Active Leisure Complex was built in 2005 so is a relatively new complex with up to date state of the art facilities. It was opened in June 2005 by the Mayor of Berwick, John Sunderland and provides a centre piece for the community.
					<br /><br />
					The ground on which it was built previously housed the Franklin Monastery which was demolished in 1998 after years of lying in a state of disrepair. A plaque outside the leisure complex marks the spot where the monastery once stood.</p>
